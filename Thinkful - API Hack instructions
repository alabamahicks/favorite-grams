Thinkful - API Hack

Project Requirements
The application must make use of a third-party API and use the results to change the DOM.You will need to choose the API you wish to use and how you will use the data.
You must plan your app in detail before you start building. Send the sketch to your mentor so he or she can flag potential problems with it – such as data limits or technology requirements – before you start building.
Try making your project responsive using media queries, as you learned in unit 1.



===============================================================================
PROJECT DEFINITION:

Display collection of images from a third party app meeting some user-specific criteria, in order to allow tagging and reordering for further decision-making about individual items, or the group as a whole.

First build: Instagram user-'liked' photos from user's account.

Presently, in order to view images I've 'liked' on Instagram, I must use the mobile app, and drill into my account.  I can only see a recent-first series of images.  I have no way to filter those images in order to see multiple images at the same time conforming to certain criteria, and the display area of the phone is limited.

This app will improve this situation by:

Accessing my 'liked' images on Instagram via the JSONP API;
Filtering those images based on attributes of the delivered items;
	Original owner of image
Displaying thumbnails/owners of these images in a responsive grid on my desktop monitor;
	(future: specific mobile device support)
Allowing annotation of the image for further decision-making;
	(future: local storage)
